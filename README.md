# tylercrumpton's Solutions and Scripts for Advent of Code 2021
_Please take anything you find here with a grain of salt. Most of these should work, but in the heat of trying to knock out a solution at midnight as fast as possible, some things might be broken._
## Notes
* Everything here is written in Python, and was run on Python 3.10.0. 
* I may go back and flesh some of these solutions out and fill in the missing puzzles, but I lost a lot of steam towards the end of this year's.
* AoC is always a fun time each year, so I'm excited for 2022!
